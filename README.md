# Styre
A simple and crappy manager for BOINC written with Spring Boot.  It can view the current tasks and un/pause execution by interfacing with ```boinccmd```.

The standard BOINC manager stopped working on my machine, so I thought it would be quicker and less frustrating to write a really simple one than try to get some C or whatever to compile with GTK.
